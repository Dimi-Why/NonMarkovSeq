# NonMarkovSeq

In this project, an ML algorithm is created that can be used on a 
non-markovian sequence. Each element of the sequence is modeled by an MLP,
and the ouput of the next element depends on the output of the previous element.
Global features are also taken into account and are the same for each element.
